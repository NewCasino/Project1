Using the menu below, you can set the maximum loss limit per day, week or month. Once a limit has been set, you will receive a confirmation by e-mail. You can reduce your limit at any time you want using this menu. However if you want to remove or increase your limit, a 7 day waiting period comes in place. This period allows you the time to consider your change.
