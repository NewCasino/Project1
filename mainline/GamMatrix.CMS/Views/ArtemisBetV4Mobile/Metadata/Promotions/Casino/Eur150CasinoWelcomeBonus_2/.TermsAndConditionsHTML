<br /><strong>Earning Casino Frequent Player Points</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>When you play casino games at ArtemisBet.com with real money, you earn Casino Points at all games. These points can be converted to cash whenever you like as long as you have a balance of at least 200 points.</p>
<br /><strong>View and Claim Points</strong><span></span>
<p>You can always monitor your Casino Points balance on the casino page, and remember, at ArtemisBet.com we are all about fair play, so earned points never expire. To convert your Casino Points to money, simply click the Claim button below the Casino Points balance. Every 100 points pay &euro;1, and these funds are instantly credited to your account. If you have chosen a different currency for your casino account, you will get the equivalent of &euro;1 per 100 points paid in your preferred currency.</p>
<br /><strong>Earning Points</strong><span></span>
<p>Games generate Casino Points at different rates. View the terms &amp; conditions below to see how much points you earn playing your favourite games. The rate is expressed as a percentage, which means how much of 1 casino point you earn every time you bet &euro;1. And of course, all bets count, even if you bet less than &euro;1. For instance, one of our popular video slots, Gonzo's Quest, earn at a rate of 20%. This means that if you bet &euro;10, you will earn 2 Casino Points.</p>
