<p>Dear $USERNAME$, <br />
</p>
<br />
Thank you for contacting [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)]<br />
<br />
Your personal deposit limit is set to&nbsp;$NEWLIMITAMOUNT$ $NEWLIMITPERIOD$. <br />
<br />
This deposit limit is independent from any limits set by your chosen payment service provider. <br />
<br />
You can reduce your deposit limit immediately&nbsp;using the same menu within the Responsible Gaming area of the site. <br />
<br />
However, if you wish to increase your limit, it will take&nbsp;3 days before the new limit&nbsp;is activated.&nbsp;The three day period is given so that it allows you the time reconsider the change if necessary.<br />
<br />
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries at <a href="mailto:[Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Email_SupportAddress)]">[Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Email_SupportAddress)]</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>[Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] Customer Support Team&nbsp; 
</p>
