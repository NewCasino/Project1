    You can always monitor your Casino Points balance on the casino page, and remember, at Jetbull we are all about fair play, so earned points never expire. <br>
  </p>
  <p>To convert your Casino Points to money, simply click the Claim button below the Casino Points balance. Every 100 points pay €1, and these funds are instantly credited to your account.

  <p> <strong>Earning Rates</strong> <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Games generate Casino Points at different rates. View the terms &amp; conditions below to see how much points you earn playing your favorite games. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The rate is expressed as a percentage, which means how much of 1 casino point you earn every time you bet €1. And of course, all bets count, even if you bet less than €1. <br>
  </p>
  <p>For instance, one of our popular video slots, Diamond Dog, earn at a rate of 20%. This means that if you bet €10, you will earn 2 Casino Points.</p>
