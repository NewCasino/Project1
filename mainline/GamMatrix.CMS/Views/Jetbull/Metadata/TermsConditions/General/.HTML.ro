      <li>Filtering Systems - Filtering solutions allow parents to regulate access to the internet, based on chosen criteria.Parents can use filters to prevent their children from accessing, amongst other things, gambling websites.If you share your computer with friends or family who are under the legal age to register or bet with our site, or have requested self-exclusion from gambling sites, please consider parental filtering solutions</li>
      <li>Setting of Financial Limits &#8211; A player may set financial limits mainly related to wagers and losses by contacting our Support team.Once these limits are set the player will not be able to exceed these limits.</li>
      <li>Setting of Session Time Limits &#8211; A player may set maximum Session Time Limits by contacting our support team.Once these limits are set the player will not be allowed to continue playing above the pre set time limit in any one session.</li>
