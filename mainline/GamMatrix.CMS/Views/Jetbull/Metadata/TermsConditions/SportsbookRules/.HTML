<p><strong><em>Examples</em></strong>: Milan - Inter abandoned in min 74 at 2-0, half time score 1-0</p>
<p>I win if I placed a bet on Milan to win First Half</p>
<p>I lose if I placed a bet on Over 1.5 Goals at half time</p>
<p>-&gt; I win if I placed a bet on Over 1.5 Goals Full time</p>
<p>-&gt; I will get my stake back if I placed a bet on O/U 2.5 Full time</p>
<p>-&gt; I will get my stake back if I placed a bet on Milan to win at Asian Handicap -1.5</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>6. Over/Under: In the event of a game being abandoned before 90 minutes have been played all bets are void unless settlement of bets is already determined. Please refer to the following examples regarding settlement of bets:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Example 1:</em></strong></p>
<p>Over Under 2</p>
<p>I place a bet on Over 2.</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals scored is higher than 2 (e.g. final score: 2-1, 2-3, 3-0,</li>
</ul>
<p>1-3, 3-3, 2-2, etc.)</p>
<p>-&gt; I lose the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals score is lower than 2 (e.g. final score: 0-0, 1-0, 0-1)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I get my stake back when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals score is 2 (e.g. final score: 1-1, 2-0, 0-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Example 2: </em></strong></p>
<p>Over Under 2.5</p>
<p>I place a bet on Over 2.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals scored &gt;= 3 (e.g. final score: 3-0, 0-3, 2-1, 1-2, 3-1,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-4, etc,)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I lose the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals scored &lt; 3(e.g. final score: 0-0, 1-0, 1-1, 0-1, 2-0, 0-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bets on Over Under with mixed parameter can be half won and half lost, just like in the case of mixed Asian Handicaps.</p>
<p>Examples of mixed Over Unders (OU):</p>
<ul>
<li>OU 1.75 &ndash; is the result from combining OU 1.5 with OU 2</li>
<li>OU 2.25 &ndash; is the result from combining OU 2 with OU 2.5</li>
<li>OU 2.75 &ndash; is the result from combining OU 2.5 with OU 3</li>
<li>OU 3.25 &ndash; is the result from combining OU 3 with OU 3.5</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Example 3:</em></strong></p>
<p>Over Under 2.25</p>
<p>I place a bet on Under 2.25</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals is &lt;2 (e.g. final score: 0-0, 1-0, 0-1)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I lose the when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals is &gt;=3 (e.g. final score: 2-1, 1-2, 3-0, 0-3, 2-2, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; The bet is HALF WON when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of goals scored is 2 (e.g. final score: 1-1, 2-0, 0-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; The odds and winnings calculation system is identical to the one from Asian Handicap</p>
<p><strong><em>Example4</em></strong>: Milan - Inter abandoned in min 74 at 2-0, half time score 1-0</p>
<p>-&gt; I lose if I placed a bet on Over 1.5 Goals at half time</p>
<p>-&gt; I win if I placed a bet on Over 1.5 Goals Full time</p>
<p>-&gt; If I placed a bet on O/U 1.75 Full time, the bet will be half won and half voided</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>7. Asian Handicap Full time Excluding Overtime: It is settled on the result of the game. The teams will be given various lines of handicaps and it will be the final result that counts.</li>
</ol>
<p>This betting type has only 2 outcomes, draw being excluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Away</li>
</ul>
<p>Asian Handicap can have 2 types of parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer (e.g. -/+1, -/+2, etc.)</li>
<li>Decimal (e.g. -/+0.5, -/+ 0.75, -/+1.25, etc.)</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chelsea beats Liverpool, no matter the score</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; I get the stake back when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The match ends in a draw</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; I lose the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liverpool beats Chelsea, no matter the score</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Example 2:</em></strong></p>
<p>Match: Chelsea &ndash; Liverpool</p>
<p>Asian Handicap 0.5</p>
<p>I place a bet on home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The match ends in a draw (e.g. 0-0 -&gt; by adding the advantage given by the parameter the score turns into: 0.5-0 -&gt; home wins)</li>
<li>Chelsea defeats Liverpool, no matter the score</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I lose the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liverpool beats Chelsea (e.g. 0-1, 0-2, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Example 3:</em></strong></p>
<p>Match: Chelsea &ndash; Liverpool</p>
<p>Asian Handicap -0.25</p>
<p>I place a bet on home. Odds: 2.00. Stake: EUR 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; The stake will be divided: EUR 50 going to AH 0 and EUR 50 to AH -0.5</p>
<p>-&gt; If the match ends in a draw (e.g. 1-1):</p>
<ul>
<li>EUR 50 from AH 0 will be returned to the user</li>
<li>EUR 50 from AH -0.5 will be lost (by deducting the disadvantage given by the parameter the score will turn into: 0.5 -1 -&gt; away wins -&gt; home loses</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; The final status of the bet is <strong>HALF LOST</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>For HALF LOST bets, the odds will always turn into 0.5.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So the user will be back: New odds * stake</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>-&gt; in this case: 0.5*100=EUR 50</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; I win the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chelsea beats Liverpool, no matter the score</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; I lose the bet when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liverpool beats Chelsea, no matter the score</li>

<p>For races where more than one horse is withdrawn, the deduction won&rsquo;t be any greater than 75p per GBP 1.</p>
<p>Deduction example:</p>
<p>Deduction Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You place a bet on a horse at odds of 8.00 with GBP 100.</li>
<li>30 min before the race starts, a horse at odds of 6.00 cannot run &ndash; and is deemed to be a non-runner.</li>
<li>The odds 6.00 are the last odds offered on the non-running horse.</li>
<li>Your horse wins the race at odds of 8.00 and you would normally win GBP 800.</li>
<li>Because there was a non-runner in the race, deductions will apply to your winnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your winnings will be :(( Your odds-1) x (1-reduction factor) x Your stake + Your stake)) = Your winnings (8-1) x (1 &ndash; 0.15) x GBP 100 + GBP 100 = 7 x 0.85 x GBP 100 + GBP 100 = GBP 695</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the reduction factor of 15% by looking it up in the table above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have picked a winner and where reduction factors occur, the original odds and the effective odds (after the reduction factor) will be displayed in 'My transactions' as such: 8.00 (6.95).</p>
<p><strong>Early morning prices/day of event prices</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>After the final declarations stage, Non-Runner no-bet will apply.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Double Engagements</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Where a horse is doubly engaged (named as a runner in more than one race) the bet will stand as a bet for the timed race. If the selection runs in the other race it would be treated as a non runner.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Re-runs</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>In the event of a false start or any other incident resulting in a race being re-run, 'under starter's orders' is negated and stakes will be refunded on horses taking no part in the re-run;</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Postponements</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>If a race is abandoned or declared void then any bets will be void. If the race is postponed to a future day and the final Declarations stand, all bets will stand;</li>
<li>However, all single bets on horse racing will be made void and any selection involved in accumulative bets will be treated as a non-runner if:</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The race is abandoned;</li>
<li>The race is officially declared void;</li>
<li>The conditions of the race are altered after bets have been made;</li>
<li>The venue is altered;</li>
<li>The running surface is altered (e.g. from Turf to All Weather).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ante-Post Betting</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Ante post betting will cease at the Final Declaration stage and all bets after this will be non-runner, no bet ;</li>
<li>Unless specifically stated otherwise, stakes are lost on an Ante-Post bet if a horse does not take part.</li>
<li>On days when classic or other trials occur, Ante-Post betting may be suspended and new prices issued;</li>
<li>Ante-Post bets on horses compulsorily withdrawn will be void and stakes returned. (Stewards are empowered to reduce the numbers in a race if, at the overnight declaration stage, too many have been left in for the safety of horses and jockeys. Jockey Club Rule 121).</li>
<li>Ante-Post bets are settled at the odds and place terms applicable at the time of acceptance. Should a wrong odds or place terms be given in error we reserve the right to settle the bet at the correct odds/place terms that were available at the time the bet was struck.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Each-Way Betting</strong></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>All bets are settled to win unless 'Each-Way' is selected;</li>
<li>An Each-Way bet is made up of two bets. It contains one bet for your horse to "Win" and a second bet for your horse to be "Placed". Each bet is placed at the stake amount you have entered, so the total cost of an each way bet will be double the amount you entered stake as you are placing two bets;</li>
<li>The "Place" terms will be as advertised for the event. In general, for UK horse racing the 'Place' part of Each-Way bets will be settled using the following 'Place' terms:</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Less than 5 runners - the place money is invested to win;</li>
<li>Races of 5, 6 or 7 runners - one 1/4 the odds - first two places;</li>
<li>All other races of 8 or more runners 1/5 the odds - first three places</li>
<li>Handicap races with 12 - 15 runners one 1/4 the odds - first three places</li>
<li>Handicap races with 16 or more runners 1/4 the odds - first four places</li>
<li>In all races the number of runners will be the number of runners coming&nbsp;under starters orders. Bets won't be accepted where the place stake exceeds&nbsp;the win stake.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>GREYHOUNDS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>All bets are placed on the named greyhounds;</li>
<li>Ante-Post wagers are accepted on the basis all-in run or not, entered or not;</li>
<li>Where a race is re-run all bets stand. Should a race be declared void and not re-run, all bets will be void;</li>
<li>If a named dog (No reserves) is selected and a reserve runs in place of the named dog then the bet will be settled as a non-runner;</li>
<li>All bets will stand irrespective of vacant traps, void races and abandoned meetings. Dead-heat rules apply to outright result, if multiple winners;</li>
<li>In the event of abandonment or postponement to races where early prices have been offered, all bets will stand as long as the races are rescheduled and completed;</li>
<li>Payment will be made on the official result of races. <strong>Jetbull&nbsp;</strong>reserves the right to declare void any bets where it considers there to be reasonable suspicion or evidence of unfair price manipulation.</li>

<p><strong>Race Event Bet Types &ndash; Single Selection</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Win</strong>- Select a runner to finish 1st.</li>
<li><strong>Place</strong>- Select a runner to finish in 1st, 2nd or 3rd place in a race with 8 runners or more, and 1st, or 2nd in a 6 runner greyhound race.</li>
<li><strong>Each-way (&ldquo;Fractional Place&rdquo; bet in some fractional odds markets)</strong>Select a runner to win or place. This bet consists of two bets on one selection in one event, with the first bet on the runner to&nbsp;win and the second bet on the runner to place. The place bet pays at a fraction of the win odds as specified on the event data.</li>
<li>The Each-Way bet is not offered in most countries. The game system can be configured to set the &ldquo;place&rdquo; odds at a fixed proportion of the win odds of the selection as follows:</li>
<li>Greyhounds pay 1/5th of win odds.</li>
<li>Horses pay 1/5th of win odds.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Race Event Bet Types - Multiple Selection Combination Odds</strong></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>These bet markets carry different terms in different geographical regions. Our data service uses fixed odds (&ldquo;bookie&rdquo;) terminology. The system can be configured to display pari-mutuel (&ldquo;tote&rdquo;)&nbsp;terminology on the screen systems and video renders when required. These alternative bet names are shown in parentheses below</li>
<li><strong>Forecast (Exacta)</strong>- Select 2 runners to finish 1st and 2nd IN ORDER specified.</li>
<li><strong>Combination Exacta</strong>- Some bet systems offer a player the option of selecting 2 or more selections to bet that every possible combination of two of the selections may finish 1st and 2nd in&nbsp;order. So for example; on 2 selections there are 2 bets (1-2, 2-1); on 3 selections there are 6 bets (1-2, 1-3, 2-1, 2-3, 3-1, 3-2); on 4 selections there are 12 bets, on 5 selections there are 20 bets and on 6&nbsp;selections there are 30 bets etc. This is a bet acceptance system bet that uses the Forecast odds in the feed service. The bet acceptance system works out all combinations.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Forecast (Quinella)</strong>- Select 2 runners to finish 1st and 2nd in ANY ORDER.</li>
<li><strong>Tricast or Trifecta</strong>- Select 3 runners to finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd IN ORDER specified.</li>
<li><strong>Combination Trifecta</strong>- Some bet systems offer a player the option of selecting 3 or more selections to bet that every possible combination of three of the selections may finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd&nbsp;in order in an event. So for example; on 3 selections there are 6 bets (1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 3-1-2, 3-2-1); on 4 selections there are 24 bets; on 5 selections there are 60 bets and on 6 selections there are 120&nbsp;bets. This is a bet acceptance system bet that uses the Tricast odds. The bet acceptance system works out all combinations.</li>
