The Joker Poker model of this single-hand video poker classic adds a Joker card into the deck, with the resulting top award being five-of-a-kind, good for a 4,000 payout at full bet!  You need a two pair hand to win back your bet, but the Joker means you'll see the stronger hands that much more often.
