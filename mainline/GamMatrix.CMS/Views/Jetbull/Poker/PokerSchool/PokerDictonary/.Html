  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Action</span>
<br>A move by a player. Hold'em involves seven basic moves: 
<br>Bet&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Put money in the pot
<br>Call&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To match / equal another player's bet
<br>Fold&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Forfeit cards and with it your chance of winning the pot
<br>Check&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Passing on making an action (if no bet is in play)
<br>Raise&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To increase another player's bet
<br>Re-Raise&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To increase another player's raise
<br>All-in&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Betting all the chips in front of you at once!
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bad beat</span>
<br>A hand that is beaten by someone getting very lucky and out-drawing that hand.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bank roll</span>
<br>The sum of your total account stack.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Betting Rounds</span>
<br>Every poker hand played is divided into four betting rounds which start on the player left of the button in the first position making an action. These are as follows; 
<br>Pre-flop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The betting round before the flop.
<br>Flop round&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flop has been dealt and betting starts again.
<br>Turn round&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comes after the fourth community card has been dealt.
<br>River round&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This comes after the fifth and final betting round. This is followed by the showdown.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Blind</span>
<br>The blinds, small forced bets, are placed before any cards are dealt. One player posts a big blind and the other a small blind. The small blind is half the amount of the big. The amount of the blinds depends on the limit being played.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bluff factor</span>
<br>Betting and raising with a hand that you are fairly certain is not the best hand. The idea with this is to bluff or scare your opponent into folding.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Board</span>
<br>The five community cards that all the players can see and use to build their hand. 
<br>Flop&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first three community cards to be dealt.
<br>Turn&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth community card
<br>River&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth and final community card
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bust</span>
<br>You're bust when you lose your entire table stack or bank roll. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Button </span>
<br>Virtual dealer marker moved from player to player in a clockwise direction after each hand. The player on the button always acts last. Consequently the player left of the button, in the first position, always acts first. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cap</span>
<br>There can only be a maximum of three raises in any given betting round. The last raise is called the cap. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cracked </span>
<br>When the fantastic starting hand of two aces is beaten &ndash; the aces are cracked. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Community cards</span>
<br>The five cards on the board shared by all players. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Connectors </span>
<br>Starting hands that are connected through their value like J-10, A-K and 7-8. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dominated</span>
<br>A hand that is subdued by another hand. For example AK would dominate AJ if an ace falls on the board. The dominated hand has a lower kicker (J) and little chance of winning. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Draw hand</span>
<br>A hand that needs a certain community card to come into play in order to win &ndash; most commonly with a straight or a flush. The starting hand of J10 of spades on a 8s 9s and Ah flop would be a very good drawing hand. You have 7 or a Q for the straight and any spade for the flush. If Qs or 7s hit you even have a straight flush! But if none of these cards hit, the hand is worthless. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Drawing dead</span>
<br>A hand that cannot win even though the entire board is not yet on the table. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Edge </span>
<br>In the long run, luck evens out and skill alone defines the difference required to win. Edge is the slight advantage one player has over another through better skill, a larger stack or a better position. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Grinder </span>
<br>A player who consistently plays for hours with the intent of slowly and carefully building a large bank roll. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Fish </strong>
<br>A nickname for bad players who lose regularly &ndash; usually given this name by superior, winning players. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Flat call </strong>
<br>Making a call in a situation where a raise would have been feasible. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Freeroll </strong>
<br>A huge tournament that is free to enter. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Heads-up </strong>
<br>A one-on-one poker game. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Hole cards </strong>
<br>Your starting hand. These are sometimes referred to as pocket cards. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Gut shot </strong>
<br>A 'gutshot' draw in poker is an inside straight draw. For instance, if you have 2-3-4-6, you have a gutshot straight draw -- any 5 will make your straight.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Inside straight </strong>
<br>On a 5, 9, Q flop with 6, 7 hole cards, an 8 would make the inside straight! 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Kicker </strong>
<br>When two players hold equal hands such as the same pair, the highest unpaired card is called the kicker and it decides the winner. For more info, see Dominated. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Limit </strong>
<br>The dollar value of the blind. Defines how "big" the game is. Obviously you need a much larger stack to play a $50 limit game than a $0.50 game. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Limping </strong>
<br>Calling the big blind in pre-flop action.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Nuts</strong>
<br>To hold the best combination of cards currently possible. Remember, although you have the nuts on the flop, you may lose after the turn and the river. Holding J10 a flop of 7, 8 and 9 would give you the nuts &ndash; the best possible straight! But if the turn or river brings another 9, a guy holding 99 would now have a four of a kind making them the nuts. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Position</strong>
<br>A player's position in relation to the dealer's button. As the button moves so does your position. These are defined as follows; 
<br>Early&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first three seats left of (after) the button. The least desirable positions as these players must make their moves first.
<br>Middle&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Seats 4 to 7 after the button.
<br>Late&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Positions 8 and 9. Playing out of this position gives players an edge since they have already seen the other player's moves.
<br>On the button&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This seat acts last and as such, has an even bigger edge than the late position.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Open-ended straight </strong>
<br>A straight draw that can hit both ways. With a J10 on the flop, a player holding KQ has an open-ended straight draw, hitting with an ace or a nine. See Gut shot and Inside straight.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Outs</strong>
<br>The total number of possibilities a player has to win a pot based on the current situation. If he holds 99 and needs another 9 to win, then he would have a total of two outs.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Over card</strong>
<br>Pocket cards that have a value higher than the highest card currently on the board. An ace and a king are over cards to a 57J flop.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Pocket pair </strong>
<br>Holding two equally valued cards like AA, KK, 77 or 22.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rag </strong>

<br>
<strong>A set</strong>
