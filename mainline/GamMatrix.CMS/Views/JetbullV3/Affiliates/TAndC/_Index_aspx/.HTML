<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We retain the right to change the REVENUE SHARE AND NET GENERATED REVENUE percentage and method of calculation of Revenue Share as we wish in accordance with clause 1.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. FORBIDDEN PRACTICES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.1 You may not in any way offer added rewards of any kind to your Referred Customers without Jetbull&rsquo;s prior written consent. If Jetbull deems you to be in breach of this condition, Jetbull may terminate your affiliate agreement and seize to pay you any further Revenue Share from your Referred Customers (see Term 13.2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2 Neither you nor your direct relatives (spouse, partner, parent, child or sibling), may under no circumstance receive any Revenue Share on your own or direct relatives&rsquo; customer account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.3 You are forbidden to in any way modify, redirect, suppress, or substitute the operation of any button, link, or other interactive feature of the Jetbull Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.5 You shall at all times comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and any other related or similarlegislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5.6 When advertising to potential United Kingdom players, you shall  abide by the UK rules for gambling advertising as defined by the  Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP and BCAP) and upheld by the  Advertising Standards Authority. You will ensure that marketing  communications, particularly in relation to free bet and bonus offers do  not amount to or involve misleading actions or misleading omissions.  Marketing communications that include a promotion must provide as such  information about significant conditions as practicable within the  advert itself, and with sufficient prominence. Where the advert is  genuinely limited by space (banner advertisement) significant conditions  must be displayed no further than one click away from the advert  itself. Examples of free bet or bonus offers which may not comply with  UK legislation include: the promotion does not provide supporting  information on the terms and conditions of the offer or provides it with  insufficient prominence for example only visible once scrolled down;  when clicked, advertising banners take a customer direct to the join or  login section of the website, without providing terms and conditions of  the offer; significant information may only be available &lsquo;below the  fold&rsquo; on a web page or email and a customer may only be aware that terms  and conditions apply if they actively scroll to the end of a webpage or  similar. The above requirements are applicable to all forms of  marketing communication, including social media and other forms of  advertising such as newspapers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.2 Jetbull shall use its best endeavors to ensure that whenever a Referred Customer signs-up with Jetbull through your affiliate link with your tracking code attached the relevant Customer is identified as originating from the Your Website.
