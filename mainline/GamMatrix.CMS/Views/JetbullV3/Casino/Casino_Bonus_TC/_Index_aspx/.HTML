<p>1. All bonuses are limited to one person per household address and IP address.</p>
<p>2. Your qualifying deposit and the granted bonus amount will be held in your Casino Bonus balance and will remain there until the wagering requirement is met.</p>
<p>3. You can monitor your remaining wagering requirement(s) by going to <em>My Account -&gt; Active Bonuses -&gt; Casino</em>.</p>
<p>4. All bonuses expire 30 days after being awarded, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>5. If the bonus expiry date is reached, or if you wish to withdraw your qualifying deposit <strong>before</strong> the wagering requirement is met, the bonus funds and any associated winnings from the bonus funds will be deducted from your balance. In the case of a net loss of bonus balance, this loss will be deducted from your qualifying deposit amount.</p>
<p>6. You can forfeit any active bonus at any time by navigating to <i>My Account -&gt; Active </i><em>Bonuses</em> -&gt; <em>Casino</em>, or by contacting customer support.</p>
<p>7. The majority of games contribute 100% towards the wagering requirement, but please note that some games contribute less. Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbull.com/Casino/Info/bonus-contribution">here</a></span> for a complete list of games and their wagering contribution.</p>
<p>8. In the interest of fair gaming, there is a maximum stake allowed per game round when you are betting with bonus funds. This maximum stake is 10% of the total bonus amount granted, or &euro;10, whichever is the larger amount. So for example, if you deposit &euro;150, we&rsquo;ll add &euro;150 as bonus funds and your maximum stake per game round is &euro;15 (10% of &euro;150). If you deposit &euro;50, we&rsquo;ll add &euro;50 as bonus funds and your maximum stake per game round is &euro;10 (&euro;10 is larger than 10% of &euro;50 (&euro;5)).<br /><br />Should you bet more than this maximum stake per game round, you agree that your bonus and any associated winnings may be void.</p>
<p>9. Bonus funds can be wagered on all casino games, except; all Video Poker Games; non-live Table Games and the following slot games: Scrooge, Devil&rsquo;s Delight, The Wish Master, Pearls of India, Tower Quest,&nbsp;Loaded, Thunderstruck, Egyptian Heroes&trade;, Wild Turkey, Lights, South Park&trade;, Jack and the Beanstalk, Flowers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Players residing in or holding a citizenship in the following countries are excluded from all casino bonuses: Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Greece.</p>
<p>11. In the event a bonus is not credited after a qualified deposit has been made, please contact customer support at support@jetbull.com or Live Chat <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span>&nbsp;any bets are made, and Jetbull support staff will manually grant the bonus. If you do not wait for the bonus to be set up before betting, our system will not allow us to credit your account with the bonus funds.</p>
<p>12. Maximum winnings from wagers made with bonus funds is &euro;10,000, or your acount currency equivalent of &euro;10,000, unless otherwise stated. This limitation does not apply to Progressive Jackpot wins.</p>
<p>13. <span lang="EN-US">While you have a bonus balance, this balance will  be wagered first. If a bet is larger than the bonus balance, the remaining amount required to place the bet will automatically be taken from your real money balance to complete the bet and <strong>the bet will still be considered a bonus bet</strong>. Alternatively, you can reduce the bet amount to be equal to or smaller than your bonus balance, or surrender the remaining bonus funds (<i>refer clause 6</i>).</span></p>
