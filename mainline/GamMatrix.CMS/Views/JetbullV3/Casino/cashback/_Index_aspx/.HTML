<p>Jetbull is all about #PurePassion, which means we do everything we do with passion, from providing the games and sports events to bringing you the offers we think they fit better for you. In the same time we appreciate the passion we see in you, our players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we decided to bring you a new type of continuous offer, where we have your back, so you can play more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is it working? You have fun, sometimes win, sometimes learn. That's how it is working, right? Well, for the times when the luck isn't by your side, we return 10% of your net loses back to your account. We will start to calculate the amount to be returned for intervals of 2 weeks, starting with 1st of November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will get your cash back (10% of the net loses) every second Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.g. in November, we will calculate what you played in the period 1-15 Nov and on 16th of Nov we will calculate and return 10% of the net loses you had for this interval. The next interval will be 16-30 Nov, as on 1st of December to calculate the amount for this second period.&nbsp;</p>
