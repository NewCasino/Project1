<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Channels/Touchpoints:</span> Website for PC/Desktop, Website for Mobile; Mobile Apps; Social Media; Email; Live Chat.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the advances in technology isn&rsquo;t getting all channels right in isolation, it&rsquo;s tying them together into a consistent customer experience, seamlessly joining up an increasing number of different touchpoints.</p>
<p>Expectations are a huge aspect of customer experience, so consistency of information across the different channels is important. An experience that involves interactions with several touchpoints to solve a simple problem is infuriating and customers don&rsquo;t just want personalized experiences, they want them delivered in the channel that suits them best.</p>
