<li><strong>Where do I find promotions available to me?</strong>
<p>You will always find available promotions by visiting the [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] <a href="/Promotions/home">Promotions</a>&nbsp;section. However, we also publish promotions via SMS, notifications on mobile devices, newsletters, Facebook and Twitter. We strongly suggest that you accept SMS and e-mails from Jetbull (this is set in My Account/Profile), as some of our greatest offers are sent to you this way.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How do I get a deposit bonus?</strong>
<p>This is made very easy with Jetbull.com as we list all bonuses available to you when you make a deposit. If you can choose between more bonuses, simply select the one you prefer from the list!</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I surrender/forfeit a bonus?</strong>
<p>Yes, you can surrender a bonus before you start to play or even after you have placed bets with the bonus funds. However, if you surrender a bonus after betting with it, any won amount will be surrendered and any losses will be deducted from your real funds. To surrender a bonus, go to&nbsp;'<a href="/Profile">My account</a>', then select <em>Active Bonuses</em> and <em>Casino</em> from left menu. Click <em>Forfeit</em> button found under your active bonus to surrender it.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I play all games and bet on any sports with my bonus?</strong>
<p>Most casino bonuses are available for all games, while some bonuses might be limited to a specific brand, or game type. For instance only Net Entertainment games or only Video Slots. The same applies to sports bonuses - some bonuses might only be available for a specific sport or betting type. However, if any such restrictions, this is always clearly specified in the terms &amp; conditions of the bonus. If in doubt, please contact [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] <a href="/customersupport">Customer Support</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>How do I check that I have met the wagering requirement for a bonus?</strong>
<p>You can check your progress in '<a href="/Profile">My account</a>' - 'Active Bonuses'.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>For what reasons can I be excluded from a promotion?</strong>
<p>Some of the promotions will be eligible only for customers from certain countries or that are using specific payment methods. There may also be restrictions based on previous misuse of [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] promotions. For any assistance, please contact [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] <a target="_blank" href="/customersupport">Customer Support Team</a> by mail at <a href="mailto:[Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Email_SupportAddress)]" target="_blank">[Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Email_SupportAddress)]</a> or via Live Chat.</p>
