<br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> <strong>Earning Casino Frequent Player Points (FPP):</strong>
<p>When you play casino games at [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] with real money, you earn Casino Frequent Payer Points (FPP) on all games. These FPP can be converted into cash and so we offer you cashback on your casino betting.</p>
<p>Games generate FPP at different rates. <a href="[Metadata:value(.FppRatesUrl)]" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see how many points you can earn playing your favourite games. The rate is expressed as a percentage, which means how much of 1 Casino Point you earn every time you bet &euro;1. And of course, all bets count, even if you bet less than &euro;1.<br><br>As an example, one of our most popular video slots, Gonzo's Quest, earns you Casino Points at a rate of 20%. This means that for every &euro;10 you bet, you will earn 2 Casino Points. As 100 Casino points = &euro;1 cashback, this is equal to 0.2% cashback on your casino bets!</p>
<br /> <strong>Viewing and Claiming Points:</strong>
<p>You can monitor your FPP balance on the casino homepage when logged in. Remember, at [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] we are all about fair play, so earned points never expire.  To convert your FPP to money, simply click the 'Convert your points into cash' button below your FPP balance. Every 100 points is worth &euro;1, or your account currency equivalent, and the money is instantly credited to your account.</p>
<br /> <strong>Special Pomotions:</strong>
<p>Look out for unique FPP promotions. We sometimes increase the rate for certain games for a period of time. These promotions are published on the website, via email newsletters and SMS messages, or through our social media pages. Stay tuned!</p>
