<p><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;By selecting this bonus and making a qualifying deposit (see 2.) you will receive a 100% deposit bonus up to &euro;150 (or the equivalent amount in your account currency, for example &euro;150 = c.&pound;110).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> This bonus will only be awarded on your first deposit. To qualify for this bonus your first deposit must be equal to, or greater than, &euro;10, or your account currency equivalent of &euro;10.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The 100% Casino Welcome Bonus will be shown on the deposit page when you click the 'Select a bonus' tab. If your deposit qualifies for more than one bonus, all available bonuses will be displayed. Please ensure you select the correct bonus.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> In the rare event that the deposit bonus is not automatically granted after making a qualifying deposit, please <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbull.com/customersupport">contact us</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before any bets are made</span>, and the Jetbull support staff will manually grant you the bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that our systems will not allow us to grant you the bonus if you place bets with your qualifying deposit <strong>before</strong> the bonus is manually granted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Bonus funds can be wagered on all casino games except; all Video Poker Games; non-live Table Games and the following slots games: Scrooge, Devil&rsquo;s Delight, The Wish Master, Pearls of India, Tower Quest,&nbsp;<span>Loaded, Thunderstruck, Egyptian Heroes&trade;, Wild Turkey, Lights, South Park&trade;, Jack and the Beanstalk, Flowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The bonus and qualifying deposit amount must be wagered 30 times before any part of the deposit, bonus funds or associated winnings can be withdrawn or transferred.</p>
<p><strong>7. Your qualifying deposit and the granted bonus amount will be held in your Casino Bonus balance and will remain there until the wagering requirement is met.</strong></p>
<p>8. In the interest of fair gaming, there is a maximum stake allowed per game round when you are betting with bonus funds. This maximum stake is 10% of the total bonus amount granted, or &euro;10, whichever is the larger amount. So for example, if you deposit &euro;150, we&rsquo;ll add &euro;150 as bonus funds and your maximum stake per game round is &euro;15 (10% of &euro;150). If you deposit &euro;50, we&rsquo;ll add &euro;50 as bonus funds and your maximum stake per game round is &euro;10 (&euro;10 is larger than 10% of &euro;50 (&euro;5)).<br /><br />Should you bet more than this maximum stake per game round, you agree that your bonus and any associated winnings may be void.</p>
