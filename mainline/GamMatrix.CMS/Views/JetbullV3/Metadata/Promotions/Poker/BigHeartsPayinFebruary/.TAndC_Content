    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Much like the name suggests, cashing in is as easy as matching and winning! If you earn a Gold Card that is listed on the Match &amp; Win game board, all you have to do is simply visit the Rewards&gt;Gold Cards&gt;Match &amp; Win section when logged on to the Jetbull Poker client and click 'Redeem'. The cash prize designated to that specific Gold Card will be instantly added to your real money balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Remember, you are eligible to earn a Gold Card while seated at any stake or level of our real money ring games. In fact, you can earn a Gold Card even if you fold! Learn all about Gold Rewards <a href="/Promotions/TermsConditions/poker/GoldCards">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
