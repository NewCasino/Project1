<br>
All players earn Frequent Player Points (FPPs) when playing in our real money ring or tournament games. At Jetbull, FPPs accumulation eventually become Gold Chips, which are redeemable for free tournament play.

<br>
<br>
The question you are likely asking is, how do my FPPs become Gold Chips? The exchange process of FPPs to Gold Chips is automatic. FPPs accumulated turn in to Gold Chips at a rate of 100 FPP = 1 Gold Chip.&nbsp;

<br>
<br>
When you are dealt cards in a real money ring game, you'll earn 1 FPP for every dollar raked. At Jetbull, we believe a penny played should be a penny earned, so we're accurate down to the penny when it comes to FPPs. For example, if your table was raked $1.25, you will receive 1.25 FPP.
<br>
<br>
In tournament play, you'll earn 7 FPPs per dollar in tournament fees paid. The tournament fee paid is indicated by the "(+ $)" when registering for a tournament.
