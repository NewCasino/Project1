<strong>Loyalty Levels </strong></h2>
<br>
Loyalty Levels is our instant rewards program that awards players with cash and Gold Chips for earning Frequent Player Points (FPP) to complete Tiers. Just as there is a designated number of FPPs to earn per tier, there's a designated number of tiers to complete to advance a level. As you climb through all 50 Loyalty Levels you'll be completing multiple tiers before advancing, and of course, collecting multiple rewards within each level.

<strong>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Basics
<br>
<br></span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">Each level has a set number of tiers within it. Lower levels start with one and increase as you progress to higher levels.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">Complete all the tiers in a level to advance to the next level.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">Every tier you complete pays out according to what level you are. The higher the level you're at, the more you make.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">Once you make it to a Loyalty Level, it's difficult to fall back. The only way you will go backwards is if you fail to earn enough FPP over the course of two back-to-back months. In that case, you will be returned to level 10. You will NEVER lose a level if you are under level 11.</li></ul>

<strong>Turbo Tiers
<br>
<br></strong></h3>
We reward you every time you complete a tier, no matter how long it takes you. However, the faster you complete a tier the more rewards you'll reap with Turbo and Super Turbo Bonuses.
