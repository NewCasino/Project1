<h4>First Deposit Bonus 
</h4>
<p>Your first deposit to your Jetbull poker account will activate a 200% First Deposit Bonus of up to a maximum of $1000!</p>
<h4>Viewing First Deposit Bonus</h4>
<p>While logged on to Jetbull Poker you can view your bonus details, along with all your real money account details, via the&nbsp; My Account tab. All bonus funds are listed under the Pending Bonus section of your account.</p>
<h4>Earning Bonus Money</h4>
<p>Pending Bonus funds are earned out in $5 increments based on Frequent Player Points (FPPs) accumulated through real money ring or tournament game play. For each 83.33 FPP earned, $5 is added to your poker account.</p>
<p>When viewing your Pending Bonus within the Cashier tab, you'll find an FPP amount listed under the dollar amount. Those are the FPPs needed to earn out your next $5.</p>
<h4>Earning Frequent Player Points</h4>
<p>When you are dealt cards at any real money ring game, you'll earn 1 FPP for every dollar raked. In tournament play, you'll earn 7 FPPs per dollar in tournament fees paid. At Jetbull, we believe a penny played should be a penny earned, so we're accurate down to the penny when it comes to FPPs. For example, if your table was raked $1.25, you'll earn 1.25 FPPs.</p>

<p>The First Deposit Bonus expires 90 days after your first deposit and bonus funds not already earned out will then become unavailable.
