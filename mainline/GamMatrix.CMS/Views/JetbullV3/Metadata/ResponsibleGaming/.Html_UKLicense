<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana, geneva;"> <strong>Maintaining Control</strong> </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Gambling should be treated as a fun pastime, and not as a means to generate income. Whilst the majority of the people are able to treat gambling as recreation and spend only what they can afford to risk, for some it can be more difficult. In order to maintain control of your gambling habits we remind you to always consider the following points:&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Gambling should be done in moderation and undertaken as a form of leisure not as a genuine way of making money&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Avoid chasing your losses - there will always be another day.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Only gamble when you are in a position to cover potential losses&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Keep track of the time and monitor the amount of money you spend&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Should you need a break from gambling, this is possible by contacting our customer support team</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Self-exclusion should be used if you feel you are losing control of your gambling and you can activate self-exclusion by contacting customer support</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> If you need to talk to someone about any concerns you may have with your gambling habits, please contact one of the organisations&rsquo; detailed below under &lsquo;Gambling Counseling Organisations&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> <b>Do you have a problem?</b>&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> If you are concerned that gambling is having a negative impact on your life or someone else's then the following questions may help you find out.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 1. Does gambling prevent you from attending work or college?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 2. Do you gamble to pass time or to escape boredom?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 3. Do you gamble alone for long periods of time?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 4. Have others ever criticised you for your gambling?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 5. Have you lost interest in family, friends or hobbies due to gambling?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 6. Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you spend gambling?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 7. Have you lied, stolen or borrowed in order to maintain your betting habits?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 8. Are you reluctant to spend "gambling money" on anything else?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 9. Do you gamble until you lose all your money?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 10. After losing, do you feel that you have to try and win back the losses as soon as possible?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 11. If you run out of money when gambling, do you feel lost and in despair and feel the need to gamble again as soon as possible?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 12. Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to gamble?&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> 13. Does gambling make you depressed or even suicidal?&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;"> The more questions that you can answer "yes" to, the more likely it is that you are having difficulties with your gambling. To speak with someone who can give you advice and support, please contact one of the organisations&rsquo; detailed below under &lsquo;Gambling Counselling Organisations&rsquo;. </span></p>
