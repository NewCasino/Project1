<li><strong><strong>RESPONSIBLE GAMING AND GAMBLING</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li>We are committed to endorsing responsible gaming as a policy of customer care and social responsibility. We believe it is our responsibility to you, our customers, to ensure that you enjoy your wagering experience on our site, while remaining fully aware of the social and financial harms associated with problem gambling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit Limits - In order to assist our players in gambling responsibly, we have a Deposit Limit within each customer account. This option can be accessed within your " <a href="https://www.jetbull.com/profile.c?topic=Profile+menu%2fResponsible+Gaming&amp;topicid=2481">My Account</a>" section. Limits can be amended at anytime. A decrease in the deposit limit will take effect immediately, but an increase can only occur after a cooling-off period, in order to avoid rash decisions. If you require any further information or assistance regarding our functionality, please contact Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-exclusion - Should you need to take a break from gambling, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by the customer within 'My Account' or by contacting Support. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed for a minimum period of 6 months and will not be reactivated under any circumstances during the exclusion period. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request. Should you wish to activate permanent self-exclusion you may do so by contacting Support at <a href="mailto:Support@etbull.com">Support@etbull.com</a> stating your reasons and you will be permanently blocked with immediate effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also allow customers to block access to individual products by contacting Support. If you are considering self-exclusion, please remember to contact all gambling companies with whom you have accounts and ask to self-exclude with them too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that. We also recommend that consideration is given to the installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling websites. See Filtering Systems at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Underage Gambling - It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to open an account or to gamble on our website. We carry out age verification checks on all customers who use payment mechanisms which are available to under 18s and additionally perform random age verification checks on customers using other forms of funding mechanisms. Please note than anyone under the age of 18 found to be using the site will have any winnings forfeited and may also be reported to the authorities.</li>
<li>Filtering Systems - Filtering solutions allow parents to regulate access to the internet, based on chosen criteria. Parents can use filters to prevent their children from accessing, amongst other things, gambling websites. If you share your computer with friends or family who are under the legal age to register or bet with our site, or have requested self-exclusion from gambling sites, please consider parental filtering solutions</li>
<li>Setting of Financial Limits &ndash; A player may set financial limits mainly related to wagers and losses by contacting our Support team. Once these limits are set the player will not be able to exceed these limits.</li>
<li>Setting of Session Time Limits &ndash; A player may set maximum Session Time Limits by contacting our support team. Once these limits are set the player will not be allowed to continue playing above the pre set time limit in any one session.</li>
