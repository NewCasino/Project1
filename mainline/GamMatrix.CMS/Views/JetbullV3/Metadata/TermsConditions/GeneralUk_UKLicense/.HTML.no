By exception, when you are playing any of our live games, which conclude in real time, any inaction by a player will be taken as the player&rsquo;s choice and the game will continue and end naturally. For games where no additional action is required from you after placing a bet, for example with a slot machine, you can check the outcome of the bet by visiting your betting history. The disconnection will not have affected the game, and you will have the same chance of winning as if you had watched the outcome on your screen.&nbsp;<br />15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not accept any liability for technical failures which are caused by your equipment used to access the Website or faults which relate to your internet service provider.&nbsp;<br />15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you access the website you should be aware that you may be using equipment or a connection which is not as fast as that used by other players.

General information about this option can be found under "Responsible Gaming" section.&nbsp;<br />Limits can be amended at any time. A decrease in the deposit limit will take effect immediately, but an increase can only occur after a 24 hour cooling-off period, in order to avoid rash decisions.

Self-exclusion will happen within 24 hours from the moment we receive your request for self-exclusion from gambling. You must clearly state why you want to self-exclude and for what period, which may be no less than 6 months. Note that self-exclusion is for individuals that experience problems with gambling. Therefore, by enforcing self-exclusion you acknowledge that you may have a problem and exhibit vulnerability to gambling.&nbsp;<br />Your account will remain closed for a minimum period of 6 months and cannot be reactivated during this period. Also, as per our licence obligations you will be automatically excluded from other websites managed or operated by us on which you have registered. This will occur no later than 5 working days after your initial self-exclusion request has been received by us. If you request not to be self-excluded on other websites managed by us, a reason for this demand must equally be provided.&nbsp;<br />Your account will remain closed after the end of the self-exclusion period unless you yourself take positive action to resume gambling by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:selfexclusion@everymatrix.com">selfexclusion@everymatrix.com</a>. For additional information regarding self-exclusion and player protection, please visit our Responsible Gaming section.&nbsp;<br />We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However you acknowledge that the primary responsibility for controlling your behaviour lies with you and accept that we will not be liable if you continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that. Should you self-exclude from at least one of the websites managed and operated by us and afterwards, during the applicable self-exclusion period, succeed in opening an account, depositing and playing on another website managed by us, your deposited amounts and your subsequent winnings, if any, shall be forfeited by you, retained by us and you agree to waive any and all claims relating to the respective amounts. We also recommend that consideration is given to the installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling websites. See Filtering Systems at the bottom of this page.&nbsp;<br />29.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard account closure &ndash; standard account closure should be used only if you do not want to gamble for a brief period and general account closure can be revoked at any time during the break.
