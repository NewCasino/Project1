<p>3. In the rare event that the deposit bonus is not automatically granted after selecting the bonus on the deposit page and making a qualifying deposit, please contact <a target="_new" href="https://www.jetbull.com/customersupport">Customer Support</a> by <a href="mailto:support@jetbull.com">email</a> or <a target="_new" href=" http://www.livehelpnow.net/lhn/lcv.aspx?d=21838&amp;ms=&amp;zzwindow=21015&amp;lhnid=19692&amp;custom1=&amp;custom2=&amp;custom3=">Live Chat</a>, before placing any bets.
