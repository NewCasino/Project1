<p><b>WHAT IS JAPR</b></p>
<p><i>What is JAPR (NETELLER Joint Affiliate Program</i><i>)?</i></p>
<p>Jetbull Affiliates &amp; NETELLER have come together to provide a unique way for affiliates to earn twice while promoting any of Jetbull.com products.</p>
<p><i>How does it work? What do I earn</i><i>?</i></p>
<p>Every time one of your customers makes a&nbsp;deposit on Jetbull.com&nbsp;using NETELLER&nbsp; you will earn an additional commission of 25% of the deposit processing fee that NETELLER makes for processing the new players deposit transaction on our site</p>
<p>You will also continue to earn the ongoing revenue share from the Jetbull Affiliates program for the players.</p>
<p>Once the member is tracked to your&nbsp;affiliate account&nbsp;&ndash; every single time they make a deposit to Jetbull.com you will continue to earn a life time revenue share which is uncapped for that member from the deposit fees that are generated by that player from NETELLER.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Exclusive &euro;10 Bonus offer!</i></p>
<p>As an additional incentive, we are also giving all new customers depositing to Jetbull via NETELLER &euro;10 FREE cash!</p>
