<h3 style="text-align: center;">How do you win?</h3>
<p>The videos can be voted up until 3<sup>rd</sup> of February 2016. Then, we will count the votes and pick the 10 finalists, those with the highest number of votes.</p>
<p>A committee formed of Viorel Stan, Jetbull CEO, Daniela Asaftei, Jetbull Marketing Manager &amp; Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix will decide what is the final order of winners, based on a serious list of criteria:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Adrenaline &amp; entertainment level </strong>&ndash; is this video making us hold our breath? Or laugh out loud? Does it make us want to try it too? Whatsoever, proving adrenaline should not endanger anyone&rsquo;s wellbeing. So, have fun, but stay safe!</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Passion shown </strong>&ndash; how involved are you with your passion? How loud do you scream: <i>Jetbull, reward my passion! </i>How creative can you get when you do what you love most to do?</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Quality of the video</strong> &ndash; this involves both the technical skill and artistic skill. Do not worry, though, we are not looking for professional filmed clips, but we still need to understand what is going on out there.</p>
<p>The committee will meet, watch the 10 finalists&rsquo; videos and decide what the final order of the prizes is. <br />On 10<sup>th</sup> of February, we will announce the winners on this page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
