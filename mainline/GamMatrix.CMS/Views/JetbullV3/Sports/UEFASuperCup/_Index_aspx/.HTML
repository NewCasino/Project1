<p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">On Tuesday, 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of August, all football fans will unite to watch one single game: the UEFA Super Cup. The best of the best will face each other on the football pitch in Tbilisi: FC Barcelona and Sevilla FC.
</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">FC Barcelona is the certainly the favourite That&rsquo;s what the bookmakers think, that&rsquo;s what the gamblers feel and that&rsquo;s what the fans dream of. No wonder why &nbsp;<i>Los Cules </i>have won four of the last ten UEFA Champions League finals, and they have missed only two semi-finals in the last ten years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">But the history of this competition shows us that there is no such a thing as a sure winner before the game starts.&nbsp;<i>Los Rojiblancos</i>&nbsp;defeated the Catalans in UEFA Super Cup in 2006. (3-0 at Stade Louis II, Monaco). The Andalusians played for this trophy last year too against the other Spanish giant, Real Madrid. Moreover, Sevilla holds the record for the most victories in UEFA Cup/Europa League, having won the competition four times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">With Neymar not playing because of <span>his illness, it leaves to&nbsp;</span>Messi and Suarez to write another page of history for the <i>Blaugrana</i> side. A new victory in the UEFA Super Cup will allow them to tie AC Milan&acute;s record, who has already won this competition five times. Whatever happens, Spain will celebrate in the end: the 13<sup>th</sup> trophy make a gap with Italy even bigger.</span></p>
