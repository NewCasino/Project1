<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the one which all the best players in the world have been waiting for since &lsquo;Wimbledon&rsquo;, and there are some good reasons for this, including; $3.3M for the winners and $1.6M for the runners-up, not to mention the thrill of playing on the Arthur Ashe Stadium &ndash; all the ATP and WTA players are ready for this battle!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, let&rsquo;s see what the stakes are!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Djokovic has won 56 of 61 games he played in 2015. Having already won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, the top seed is totally ready for the third Grand Slam win for this year and the 10th&nbsp;in his career. With a 50-9 career mark in Flushing, Djokovic figures as the favorite any time he steps onto these courts. But he is not the only one with high ambitions in NYC. Federer will go for the 18th Grand Slam, Wawrinka aims for the double (Rolland Garros &ndash; US Open), while Marin Cilic will try to defend his title win last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>On the WTA side, Serena Williams is looking for her fifth consecutive Grand Slam and also to be the first player since Steffi Graf (1988) to win all the Grand Slams in the same year. The American legend is looking to make history: to tie Steffi Graf&rsquo;s record of 22 Grand Slams. Simona Halep, the second seeded, who has been in great shape on hard in the past weeks, is aiming for her first Grand Slam. Unfortunately, Maria Sharapova did not fully recover from her injury and announced her withdrawal from the competition just a few hours before it started. Still, we have <span>Kvitova,</span>&nbsp;Wozniacki and Azarenka ready to provide us with a good dose of adrenaline.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>So there&rsquo;s plenty for us to enjoy during this great two week tournament!</span></p>
