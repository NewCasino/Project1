<b>Some helpful information about withdrawals:</b> <br /><br />If the method you used to make your deposit accepts the credit of funds, then withdrawals must first be processed back to this method (this is a legal requirement based on anti-money laundering  regulations and for the security of your funds). If you've used a deposit method that doesn't allow the credit of funds, the option(s) available to you are displayed below. <br /><br /> Please note:<br /><br />- Withdrawals will be processed 24 hours after your last deposit.<br />- You always get the first withdrawal per month free of charge. Any subsequent withdrawals in the same month will incur a 1% fee, which is deducted from your withdrawal amount.<br /><br />Please see our <a href="http://help.jetbull.com/category/12-withdrawals" target="_new">FAQ</a> section for answers to the most common questions about withdrawals, or contact us via live chat.
