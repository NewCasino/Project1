<p><h1>1. The 50% Sports Welcome Bonus up to &euro;75 (or your account currency equivalent of &euro;75) is available to Jetbull customers that have not yet placed a bet in the sportsbook;</p>
<p><h1>2. The bonus is shown on the deposit page.&nbsp;By selecting this bonus and making a deposit of at least &euro;10 (or currency equivalent), the customer will instantly receive a 50% bonus up to &euro;75 (or your account currency equivalent of &euro;75);</p>
<p><h1>3. In the rare event that a deposit bonus is not automatically granted after selecting the bonus on the deposit page and making a qualifying deposit, please contact <a target="_new" href="https://www.jetbull.com/customersupport">Customer Support</a> by <a href="mailto:support@jetbull.com">email</a> or <a target="_new" href=" http://www.livehelpnow.net/lhn/lcv.aspx?d=21838&amp;ms=&amp;zzwindow=21015&amp;lhnid=19692&amp;custom1=&amp;custom2=&amp;custom3=">Live Chat</a> as soon as possible, <strong>before</strong> placing any bets. Our staff will then manually grant the bonus. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><h1><strong>Please note that we are unable to grant a bonus, if the player places bets with the qualifying deposit before the bonus is manually granted;</strong></p>
<p><h1>4. Both the qualifying deposit amount and the granted bonus amount will be held as bonus funds until the bonus wagering requirement has been met;</p>
<p><h1>5. The total amount held as bonus funds must be wagered 15 times (15x) with all bets settled, before the bonus funds and qualifying deposit amount are released to the customer's real money balance.</p>
<p><h1>Example: customer makes deposit of &euro;150 and receives the full bonus amount of &euro;75. Qualifying deposit amount of &euro;150 + bonus funds of &euro;75 = &euro;225. &euro;225 must be wagered 15 times (15x) before the bonus funds and qualifying deposit amount are released to the customer&rsquo;s real money balance</p>
<p><h1>For the following countries, the wagering requirement is 20 times (20x): Australia, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Russia,  Slovenia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom;</p>
<p><h1>6. This bonus is not currently available to customers from Serbia and Bulgaria;</p>
<p><h1>7.&nbsp;The wagering requirement must be met within 30 days of the customer's qualifying deposit;</p>
<p><h1>8. The customer has the right to cancel this bonus at any time by contacting <a href=" http://www.jetbull.com/customersupport">Customer Support</a> by <a href="mailto:support@jetbull.com">email</a> or <a target="_new" href=" http://www.livehelpnow.net/lhn/lcv.aspx?d=21838&amp;ms=&amp;zzwindow=21015&amp;lhnid=19692&amp;custom1=&amp;custom2=&amp;custom3=">Live Chat</a>. Upon cancelling a bonus, only the customer&rsquo;s qualifying deposit amount will be returned to their real money balance. Any winnings from bets placed with bonus funds will be cancelled. In the case of a net loss of bonus balance, this loss will be deducted from the qualifying deposit amount and only the remaining balance will be added to the customer&rsquo;s real money balance;</p>
<p><h1>9. Only bets with odds 2.0 or higher are permitted while betting to meet the wagering requirement;</p>
<p><h1>10. When placing bets with the bonus funds, only up to a maximum of &euro;50, or currency equivalent, will count towards the wagering requirement per bet;</p>
<p><h1>11. The following betting type is excluded when bets are placed with the bonus funds: <em>Outrights and Horse Racing;</em></p>
