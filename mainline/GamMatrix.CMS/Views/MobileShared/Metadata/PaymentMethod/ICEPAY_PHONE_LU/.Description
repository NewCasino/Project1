The Pay by Phone method of payment is exactly what it sounds like: payments by telephone, and is also suitable for payments made from a mobile telephone. Consumers call a number and pay by the minute, or per call. This method of payment is ideal for so-called 'micropayments', and for offering a method of payment to target groups who do not have a credit card or their own bank account.
