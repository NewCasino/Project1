Multibanco is a popular post-pay payment method in Portugal. It can be used by shoppers with a bank card issued by any bank affiliated to the Multibanco service.
The service is supported by all major banks in the country, and is therefore accessible to the maximum number of shoppers. 
There are currently more than 20 million Multibanco cards, most of which are co-branded as Visa or MasterCard.
