<strong>Earning Points </strong>
<p>
Games generate Casino Points at different rates. View the terms & conditions below to see how much points you earn playing your favourite games. 
The rate is expressed as a percentage, which means how much of 1 casino point you earn every time you bet €1. And of course, all bets count, even if you bet less than €1. 
For instance, one of our popular video slots, Gonzo's Quest, earn at a rate of 20%. This means that if you bet €10, you will earn 2 Casino Points.

<br />
<strong>Special Promotions</strong>
<p>
Look out for our unique Cash Rewards promotions. We sometimes increase the rate for certain games for a period of time. Check out the news section on the casino page for games that earn at an even higher rate.
