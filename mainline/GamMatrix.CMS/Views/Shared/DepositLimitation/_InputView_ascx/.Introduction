Using the menu below, you can select on how much you want to deposit to your account, per day, week or month. These limits are independent for the limits or minimums offered by the methods mentioned on the deposits page. Once a limit has been set, you will receive a confirmation by e-mail. You can reduce your limit at any time you want using this menu. However if you want to remove or increase your limit, a 7 day waiting period comes in place. This period allows you the time to consider your change.
