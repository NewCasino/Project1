Using the menu below you can set a session time limit. If you exceed the session time limit, you will be logged out from the system and you will be able to resume playing by logging in again. Once a limit has been set, you will receive a confirmation by e-mail. You can reduce your limit at any time you want using this menu. However if you want to remove or increase your limit, a 7 day waiting period comes in place. This period allows you the time to consider your change.

NOTE: the change made here may not take effect until your next login.
