The first form of Roulette was devised in 17th century in France by the mathematician Blaise Pascal. In the early 1800s this game was brought to the U.S.  and Europe. Thus, at present two types of Roulette exist: European and American.&lt;br/&gt;American Roulette is played on the wheel that consists of 38 slots, each with its own number. The numbers on the wheel of American Roulette are 1-36, 0 and 00. A second zero - 00 - is the main thing that differs American Roulette from the popular European version.
