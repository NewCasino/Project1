The present-day versions of Baccarat are a French variation of the Italian game called 'Baccara'. It was first introduced to France at the end of the 15th century, where it was considered a game of the nobility. While modern versions of Baccarat are simple to master and fun to play, they are still considered as some of the most sophisticated games in a modern casino. Baccarat is a game of chance between the player and the banker. The goal of the game for the player is to draw a two- or three-card hand with a value closer to 9 than the banker's hand.
