To start the game, you should buy a card. The area on the left contains 25 squares arranged in five vertical and five horizontal rows (as in a traditional bingo card). Each space in the grid contains a number (from 1 to 75), except for the center square, which is considered filled. As while playing a scratchie, you should scratch the area on the right to reveal numbers of 18 drawn balls. While numbers are revealed, the matches are marked on your card. If the matches form any of the winning patterns, you are paid according to the paytable.
