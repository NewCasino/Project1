Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. Blackjack's precursor was vingt-et-un ('twenty-one'), which originated in French casinos around 1700. In BlackJack a player competes against the Dealer. The goal of the game for a player is to beat the Dealer's hand by either getting a better hand without exceeding 21 or by the Dealer's hand going bust (going over 21).
