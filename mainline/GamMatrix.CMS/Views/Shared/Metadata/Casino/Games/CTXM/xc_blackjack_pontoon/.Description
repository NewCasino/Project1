Pontoon is considered to be an early variation of the original Blackjack game played nowadays. The game is played with 8 regular decks against the 4 decks used in the original Blackjack. The goal is to come as close to 21 without going over, while still having a higher total than the Dealer as in a standard Blackjack game. In Pontoon any five-card hand (not busted) or a "pontoon" (the same as "blackjack" hand) pays 2 to 1, including after splitting. Re-splitting is available (up to 3 hands in total). However there is no dealer up card and the dealer wins on ties.
