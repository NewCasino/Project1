Blackjack Surrender is an exciting realization of the well-known Blackjack game. In Blackjack Surrender, a player competes against the Dealer. The goal of the game for a player is to beat the Dealer's hand by either getting a better hand without exceeding 21 or by the Dealer's hand going bust (going over 21). The only difference from the classical Blackjack game is Surrender option that allows a player to surrender after first two cards are dealt to him.
