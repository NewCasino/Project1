If you are looking for a change of pace from traditional blackjack but insist on a game with a low house edge, then you may find new excitement in Spanish Blackjack. Each Spanish deck consists of 48 cards — the regular 52 cards less the four tens. An extremely helpful option in Spanish Blackjack is that players can surrender after doubling. The dealer takes the double portion of the bet, and the player retains the original bet. The great news is that player's 21 always wins and player's Blackjack beats the Dealer's Blackjack.
