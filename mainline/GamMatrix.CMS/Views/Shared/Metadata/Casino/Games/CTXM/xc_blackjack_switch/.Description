Blackjack switch is a blackjack variant, which allows the player to do what is normally considered a classic cheating manoeuver, trading cards between two hands. The player must make two bets of equal size and is allowed to switch the second card dealt to each hand. Of course nothing comes free, a dealer 22 results in a push and blackjacks pay even money. Just switch when you hitch!
