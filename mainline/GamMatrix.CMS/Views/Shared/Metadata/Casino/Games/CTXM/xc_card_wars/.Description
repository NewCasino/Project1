Card Wars may be considered one of the easiest games to play at online casinos and land-based casinos but this is not a reason to shun it away. It is a game of fun and excitement with very fair odds and although it may not have all of the rich history of some other casino games, it keeps us feeling young as we think about the game of War that it derived from. Card Wars is played between a player and the Dealer. The object of the game is to get a higher card than the dealer's card.
