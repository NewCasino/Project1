4-Line Deuces Wild is a video poker game played with 4 standard 52-card decks, shuffled after each game. Each line makes use of a different deck and each line is treated as a separate hand. All the winning hands are paid according to the paytable, so the winning amount is cumulative. The game is called 4-Line Deuces Wild because a deuce ("two" card) stands for any card and helps to turn a losing hand into a winning one very quickly.
