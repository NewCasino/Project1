50-Line Deuces Wild is a video poker game played with 50 decks, each consisting of 52 cards. It differs from the original Deuces Wild game, since it has 50 lines of cards. Each line makes use of a different deck and is treated as a separate hand. If you have winning hands on multiple lines, your winnings are added. The game is called Deuces Wild because the deuces (the ‘two’ card) can serve as a replacement for any card.
