Roulette consists of a Roulette wheel and a table. The pockets of the wheel in European Roulette range from 1 to 36 alternate between red and black, there is one green pocket numbered 0. Once the bets are placed on the table, a small ball is released on to the spinning wheel, in the opposite direction to the spin. The ball stops in one of the numbered pockets. The number that the ball rests on is declared as the winning number for that game.
