Five Aces Video Poker uses a special 53-card deck that includes an extra Ace. This extra Ace can help make Ace pairs, 3-of-a-Kind, 4-of-a-Kind and especially 5 Aces hands. It can also serve as an Ace to complete normal straights (either A-K-Q-J-10 or 5-4-3-2-A), but it won't make Flush or Straight Flush hands since for those you still need five cards of the same suit. &lt;br/&gt; The objective is to get the best paying winning combination, payouts start with a minimum hand of a pair of jacks.
