Gold in Bars is a classic slot-machine with three reels and one payline, where up to 5 coins can be placed per line.&lt;br/&gt;Combinations of BAR-symbols are the most profitable and therefore longed-for. The game involves a Jackpot feature with 2% of each bet placed in the game going to the common pot. To hit a Jackpot you need to place a 5-coin bet and have three Triple Bar symbols lined up.
