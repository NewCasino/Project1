Casino Hold’em is a variation of the popular Texas Hold’em poker game. Casino Hold’em differs from Texas Hold’em in that it is played against the house rather than against other players. The object of the game is to beat the Dealer’s hand by getting the best possible five-card hand out of the two cards you are dealt and five community cards. To add to the excitement, there is a possibility to place AA side bet, which pays out if a pair of Aces or higher is dealt in the first five cards.
