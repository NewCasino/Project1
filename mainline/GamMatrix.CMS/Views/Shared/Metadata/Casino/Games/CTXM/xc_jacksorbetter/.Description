Jacks or Better is a classical video poker game played with a standard 52-card deck, shuffled after each round. The game is played between a player and the Dealer. Once a player places a bet of one or more credits, he is dealt five cards. The player chooses which of 5 cards he wants to hold and which to discard. The cards discarded are replaced with new ones from the deck. Thus, while playing Jacks or Better the goal is to obtain a five-card poker hand that contains at least one pair of Jacks.
