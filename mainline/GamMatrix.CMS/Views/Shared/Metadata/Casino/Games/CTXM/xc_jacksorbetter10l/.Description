10-Line Jacks or Better is a video poker game played with 10 decks, each consisting of 52 cards. This game differs from the original Jacks or Better, since it has several lines of cards. Each line uses a different deck of cards. If you have winning hands on multiple lines, your winnings are added. The minimal paying combination is Jacks or Better. To get Jacks or Better, you need a hand with a pair of Jacks, Queens, Kings or Aces.
