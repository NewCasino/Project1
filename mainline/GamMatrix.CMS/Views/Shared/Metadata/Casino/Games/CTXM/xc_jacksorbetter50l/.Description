50-Line Jacks or Better is a video poker game played with 50 decks, each consisting of 52 cards. The number of decks is the same as the number of hands involved in the game. This game differs from the original Jacks or Better, since it has several lines of cards. Each line uses a different deck of cards. If you have winning hands on multiple lines, your winnings are added. The minimal paying combination is Jacks or Better.
