This game differs from the original Joker Wild, since it has four lines of cards. Each line uses a different deck of cards. Each line is treated as a separate hand for the determination of any wins.&lt;br/&gt;The object of 4-Line Joker Wild is to obtain a five-card poker hand that contains a winning combination.  Payouts start with a pair of Kings that has appeared at least in one hand. &lt;br/&gt;The joker is a wild card that substitutes for any other card to complete a winning hand.</
