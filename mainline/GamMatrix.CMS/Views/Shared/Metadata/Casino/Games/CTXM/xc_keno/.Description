Keno history started in China over 2000 years ago. The game was brought to the USA in the mid 1800's by the Chinese immigrants and now is played at most modern casinos. Keno is a lottery-like game, where a player needs to choose anywhere from 2 to 10 numbers out of 80 possible. The casino then draws 20 numbers at random. The player is paid out against his original wager based on how many numbers match the ones he's selected. Keno offers the possibility of winning large payouts on relatively small wagers.
