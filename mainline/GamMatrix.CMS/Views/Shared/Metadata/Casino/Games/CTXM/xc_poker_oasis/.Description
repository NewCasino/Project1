Oasis Poker is a variation of Caribbean Stud Poker. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand. Initially, the player places a bet called Ante. When the cards are dealt, the player may place another (call) bet worth twice the Ante bet and challenge the dealer, or surrender, losing the Ante bet. The player can benefit from exchanging cards before the call/fold decision, for a price of course. Exchange is the best way to do it!
