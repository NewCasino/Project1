Russian Poker is a variation of Caribbean Stud Poker. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand. Initially, the player places a bet called Ante. When the cards are dealt, the player may place another (call) bet worth twice the Ante bet and challenge the dealer, or surrender, losing the Ante bet. The player can benefit from exchanging any number of cards or buying an extra card. Even if the dealer's hand doesn't qualify, the player can buy his qualification! So much for the rules, let's play!
