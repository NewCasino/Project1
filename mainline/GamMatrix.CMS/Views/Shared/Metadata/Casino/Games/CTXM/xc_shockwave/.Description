Shockwave Poker is a unique version of video poker. The play is "normal" most of the time. However if a player gets a Four of a Kind, he enters Shockwave mode. Shockwave mode begins with the next play and lasts for ten plays or until the player gets another Four of a Kind, whichever happens first. Four of a Kind formed during Shockwave mode is paid at a bonus rate. &lt;br/&gt; The object is to obtain a five-card poker hand that contains a winning combination.  Payouts start with a pair of Jacks.
