Sic Bo is a table game, which finds its origin in the early Chinese civilizations, still played in many south-east Asian countries. In America it is known as "chuck-a-luck". Sic Bo is played with three standard dice that are shaken in a basket or plastic cup. The table it is played on is similar to a Roulette table and has many options for placing different bets. Outcomes are based on the combinations that come up on the three dice.
