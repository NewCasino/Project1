What do you get when you mix three industrious dwarves who own a gargantuan mine with lots and lots of explosives? The Boom Brothers! Players will have a blast with the surprise animations—if bomb-throwing dwarves don’t get players wanting more, maybe the sight of the crazy jet-packer will. To keep players on their toes, we've thrown in a whole raft of animation and special effects - some of them big, but some so subtle that players may find new things hours after they start playing. Boom Brothers is the second platinum video slot offering from Net Entertainment.
