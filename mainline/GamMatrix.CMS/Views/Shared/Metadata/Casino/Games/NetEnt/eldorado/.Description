The game begins with a short film featuring Gonzo the conquistador. Based on the historical character of Gonzalo Pizzaro, our conquistador sets off to find the lost city of gold - Eldorado. Gonzo then goes on to watch and encourage the player's progress in the game. Replacing the traditional reel spin, the game introduces the Avalanche feature whereby symbols fall into place in the reels. Symbols that make up a winning bet line disappears in a 3D explosion and the gaps they leave are filled with more falling symbols. As long as there are winning bet lines, there are Avalanches. This extended game play and the Free Fall feature ensures an unforgetable player experience!
