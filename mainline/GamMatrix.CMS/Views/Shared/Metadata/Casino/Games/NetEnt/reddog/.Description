Red Dog is an exciting game from the old West played with three cards. Red Dog does not really resemble any other form of poker; it is simply three cards dealt with the player betting on the spread. Also known as Between the Sheets, Red Dog is built around the concept of the spread between two cards. Players are dealt two cards and place bets on whether they think the third card's value will fall between the original two. Red Dog Progressive is a famous table game, pulling the player in with that old promise: a lucky draw can turn a broken man into a winner.
