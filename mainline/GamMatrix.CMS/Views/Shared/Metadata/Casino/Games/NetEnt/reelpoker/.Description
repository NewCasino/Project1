      Kings of Chicago™ is the first game offering from Net Entertainment that blends the essential elements of a Video Poker into a Video Slot.

      The conventional slot symbols have been replaced by a deck of cards and the player bets on winning poker hands appearing along the 5 bet lines. At the start of each round, the 15 cards from one deck are dealt into a 3 x 5 formation and the player wins with a poker combination of three of a kind or higher. For extra excitement, a single Joker card is shuffled in and doubles the wins when it completes winning hands. If this would not be enough, this innovative game also includes the Free Deals feature, trigged by three or more scatter labels, rewarding the player with a x2 multiplier on all wins!
