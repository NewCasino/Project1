A game based on hidden secrets and mysteries of the Illuminati, the symbolism of the elite is portrayed in this beautifully crafted 5-reel video slot. Expanding Wild and Scatter animations bring the game to life. A special bonus game brings the player into the fold of the secret society: Deep within the gothic corridors of power, the masked statues hide their truths - are they angels or demons? Players need to match the keys to the chests to find out. To add a little more intrigue, players can risk all or half their bonus winnings on another test of chance. Players may never look at the Key of Life or the Fleur-de-lis in the same way again.
