            We would like to reassure you that the algorithms used to generate cards on our site are completely random. Our games are developed using the same Sun Microsystem's Secure Random function for Java. The random number generator and the shuffle have been designed by a PhD in Mathematics. The software we use to randomise deals has been thoroughly tested and reveals no bias or predictability, and has been approved by eCOGRA.
