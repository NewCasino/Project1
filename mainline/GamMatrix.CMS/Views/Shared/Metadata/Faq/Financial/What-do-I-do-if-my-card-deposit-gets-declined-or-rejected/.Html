			Occasionally if you attempt to deposit a second time before your most recent deposit has gone through, it may count towards your 24 hour and weekly deposit limit and hence cause a deposit problem. The most common cause for this to occur is due to improperly filling out the fields in the request form. Please contact [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] customer service to have this rectified. Also Some credit card issuers maintain a rule that does not allow you to make direct deposits to online gaming sites. You may want to contact your card provider to discuss this matter, or try one of the e-wallet depositing options instead.
