			We aim to reply to all customer service e-mails within 24 hours. As some require more detail and investigation of an issue, response time may vary based on the nature of your inquiry. You will receive an e-mail confirmation from [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] when we have received your inquiry, to let you know we are working on an answer. If you find that you are not receiving the confirmation e-mail promptly after submitting your inquiry we would suggest that you have a look in your Junk Mail folder. [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] does not engage in the act of sending unsolicited e-mails however some aggressive mail filters may mistakenly identify our e-mails as spam and treat them as such.
