            Entering an incorrect password can often result in an 'unable to validate password' code. As passwords are case sensitive, check to ensure your Caps Lock is off. If your troubles persist, select the 'forgot password' button and a new password will be issued to the e-mail address as listed on your [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] account.
