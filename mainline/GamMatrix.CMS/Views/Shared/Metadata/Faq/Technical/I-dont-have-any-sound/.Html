            Please ensure that you have a valid sound card and your speakers are not set to mute. Check to see that you have sounds selected via the [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] 'Options' tab. The Chat Tab in the bottom right corner of the Table Screen contains an 'Options' Button where you can select 'all', 'alerts only' or 'silent'.
