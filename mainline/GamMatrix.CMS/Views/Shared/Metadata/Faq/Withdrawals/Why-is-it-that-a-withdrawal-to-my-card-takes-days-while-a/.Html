<p>
			We have a number of controls and checks that take place before any withdrawal leaves [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] and this delays withdrawals by approximately 12 hours. These checks are part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining the security of our customers funds. Any other delays will be due to the restrictions imposed by the payments providers.
