        <strong>The website is running very slow, what can I do to speed it up?</strong> 
        <p>
            If you have been experiencing a slow connection, please note the following: Having several browsers open, music programs running or downloading files can all slow your computer and/or internet connection. Your local internet service provider may also be experiencing lag. Sharing your internet connection within your household and in your local area can also slow your connection speed.

    <li>
        <strong>I don't have any sound.</strong>
        <p>
            Please ensure that you have a valid sound card and your speakers are not set to mute. Check to see that you have sounds selected via the [Metadata:htmlencode(/Metadata/Settings.Operator_DisplayName)] 'Options' tab. The Chat Tab in the bottom right corner of the Table Screen contains an 'Options' Button where you can select 'all', 'alerts only' or 'silent'.

        <strong>Do you have a MAC version?</strong>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we do not currently offer a version of our software specifically designed for the MAC. Many of our users, however, have successfully employed a PC emulator to enjoy our games. Please visit our Download Page for full details.

    <li>
        <strong>Why is my game so slow?</strong>
        <p>
            The communication between your machine and our servers has been optimized for the fastest response. If you notice that your game is moving slowly, there are two likely explanations: 1. The players on the table are taking a long time to act when it is their turn. 2. You may not have a good connection to the Internet.
