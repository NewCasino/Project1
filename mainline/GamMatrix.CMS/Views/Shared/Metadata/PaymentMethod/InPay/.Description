Bank Transfer by Inpay offers a localised banking service to various countries and is provided by Inpay. It allows you to deposit funds into your account at a lower cost than a regular international wire transfer, often free and always secure.<br />
Transfers are made to a bank account local to you and credited to your gamming account very quickly. Depending on your country and local bank clearing system, some transfers can be sent in almost real-time, however some transfers may take between 1 to 3 business days to arrive.
